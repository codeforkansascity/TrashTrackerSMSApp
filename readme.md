## Description

Trash Tracker is a simple, lightweight system that allows residents and staff of the Lykins neighborhood to report illegal dumping with a simple text message.

## Prerequisites

- [A Twilio account](http://www.twilio.com/referral/7fB3Je)
- [A Twilio phone number](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account#get-your-first-twilio-phone-number)

## Installation

To import our Twilio Studio flow, go to your Twilio studio and create a new flow. Select **Import from JSON** from the list of templates. In the next window, you can paste the Flow JSON from twilio.json in this repository.

Next, click on the Trigger Widget on the top and copy your webhook url from the Inspector Panel on the right hand. It should look like this:

```
https://webhooks.twilio.com/v1/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Flows/{FlowSid}
```

Navigate to the [Active Numbers section of the Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming) and click on the number youâ€™d like to connect to the Flow. Go to the **Messaging section** and paste your webhook url under **A Message Comes In**.

Here is what the place looks like:

## Usage

Any users can send a text message to your Twilio phone number and start the conversation! The following photo shows an example:

## Local Testing

To test local files, you need a webhook url on the public Internet. To do that, you need to install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) to expose your local network to the public Internet. After you install it and configure the authentification, enter the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ ngrok http 1337
```

Once you acquire a public url from ngrok, copy and paste it in Twilio Console > Phone Numbers > Manage > Active Numbers > Configure > Messaging > A Message Comes In. You will need to update the url everytime you run that script.
