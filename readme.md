## Description

Trash Tracker is a simple, lightweight system that allows residents and staff of the Lykins neighborhood to report illegal dumping with a simple text message.

## Prerequisites

- [A Twilio account](http://www.twilio.com/referral/7fB3Je)
- [A Twilio phone number](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account#get-your-first-twilio-phone-number)

## Installation

To import our Twilio Studio flow, go to your Twilio studio and create a new flow. Select **Import from JSON** from the list of templates. In the next window, you can paste the Flow JSON from [flow.json](./public/assets/flow.json).

<!-- Next, click on the Trigger Widget on the top and copy your webhook url from the Inspector Panel on the right hand. It should look like this:

```
https://webhooks.twilio.com/v1/Accounts/{AccountSid}/Flows/{FlowSid}
``` -->

Next, navigate to the [Active Numbers section of the Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming) and click on the number youâ€™d like to connect to the Flow. Go to the **Messaging section** and select your flow under **A Message Comes In**.

Here is what the place looks like:

## Usage

Any users can send a text message to your Twilio phone number and start the conversation! The following photo shows an example:

After the conversation is complete, you can see the object, location, and reporting number logged in the command line.

## Local Development

To test local files, run the following command:

```bash
$ node ./routes/flow.js
```

You also need a webhook url on the public Internet. To do that, you need to install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) to expose your local network to the public Internet. After you install it and configure the authentification, open a second terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
$ ngrok http 1337
```

Once you acquire a forwarding url from ngrok, copy and paste it in http_request_english and http_request_spanish widgets in your Twilio Studio flow. You will need to update the url everytime you run that script. The below photo shows an example.

To extract exif data from existing images, add image path to [extract-exif.js](./extract-exif.js), and run the following command:

```bash
$ node extract-exif.js
```

You will see exif data in the command line.
