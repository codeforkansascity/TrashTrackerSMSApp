## Description

Trash Tracker is a simple, lightweight system that allows residents and staff of the Lykins neighborhood to report illegal dumping with a simple text message. This app is one of its three repositories. It performs the function of recording the reporting messages.

## Installation
1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install -g yarn && \
    yarn install
    ```

2. Copy the sample configuration file and edit it to match your configuration

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.EXAMPLE .env
   ```
   You can find your `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` in your [Twilio Account Settings](https://www.twilio.com/console).

## Usage
To run the application, enter:

    ```bash
    $ node ./controllers/flow.js
    ```

Any users can send a text message to our Twilio phone number (816) 608-6096 and start the conversation! The following photo shows an example:

After the conversation is complete, you can go to http://localhost:1337/ to see the reporting information.

## Local Development

You will need a webhook url on the public Internet. To do that, you need to install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) to expose your local network to the public Internet. After you install it and configure the authentification, open a second terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
$ ngrok http 1337
```

Once you acquire a forwarding url from ngrok, copy and paste it in http_request_english and http_request_spanish widgets in your Twilio Studio flow. You will need to update the url everytime you run that script. The below photo shows an example.

## Other Usages

If you want to design your own app without using Twilio flow, here are some resources: 
1. To initiate or send a custom message, enter:
    ```bash
    $ node ./controllers/mms-send.js
    ```
2. To fetch a message sent to your Twilio number, enter:
    ```bash
    $ node ./controllers/mms-fetch.js
    ```
3. To set up an auto-generated reply to messages sent to your Twilio number, enter: 
    ```bash
    $ node ./controllers/sms.js
    ```
4. To send an image to your webhook url, enter the following command and go to [http://localhost:1337/](http://localhost:1337/) to see the images received.

    ```bash
    $ yarn start
    ```

## Credits
Twilio documentations have been tremendous help for this project, especially the ones on [Programmable SMS](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/node#sign-up-for-twilio-and-get-a-twilio-phone-number) and on [Twilio Studio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/studio/user-guide/get-started). The 4th usage of "other usages" of this repository uses almost all code from the Twilio repository [receive-mms-node](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/receive-mms-node).
